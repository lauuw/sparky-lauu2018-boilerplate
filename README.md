## Common Questions

### Where is the Css compiled , i can not see where it compiles the sparky variables?
It is compiled in the dist or distribution folder. This folder will contain anything processed or compiled by Grunt - https://github.com/JacobLett/Sparky/tree/master/dist/css

### Can you add more scss files in sass folder like _buttons.scss?
You sure can. Just add the underscore prefix and then reference it the style.scss file so it is imported in https://github.com/JacobLett/Sparky/blob/master/sass/styles.scss

### When you upload the site or page to the server which are the files you have to upload?
All you need is the compiled files in the dist folder. The readme file helps a future developer find the source code in a public/private repo

- dist
- README.md
- humans.txt
- index.html
- robots.txt

## How do you get grunt to stop watching the file?
All you have to do is close the shell window. If you enter the command "start grunt watch" it will open two shell windows. One watching and the other for new commands. I usually just do "grunt watch" and leave it watching all day as I go in and out of the day. Then when I go home I commit my changes to github and close the command shell.

## What chrome extension does the auto refresh?
I use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livejs/fnenjmjepccoionjgdgimlnppidghbbg
You can also include a js file in your project while developing http://livejs.com/
